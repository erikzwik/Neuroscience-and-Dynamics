# Computational Neuroscience and Nonlinear dynamics and Chaos.

In this repo will be outlined by following two books: Strogatz, Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos & Gerstner, Neuronal Dynamics. 
I've many times over tried to do courses on my own time. It's hard though, because nothing is pressing. Ever. So in order to create some sense of urgency, I will create a time-line for tasks to be done. The most natural way is to simply follow the courses as outline. 

# Gerstner
My aim is to follow the same time-spectrum as the course. 
Weekly lectures: https://lcnwww.epfl.ch/gerstner/NeuronalDynamics-MOOCall.html
Weekly coding tasks: https://neuronaldynamics-exercises.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
Try to squeeze in some time, if possible, during the week days. Then continue on weekends.
Gerstner's videos are particularily good for bitesize amounts of information. 


# Strogatz
One chapter per week, starting at chapter 4. This might be extended one chapter every second week later in the course. 
Watch two lectures per week: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbN57C5Zdl6j_qJA-pARJnKsmROzPnO9V,
and solve tasks using book or http://arslanranjha.weebly.com/uploads/4/8/9/3/4893701/solution_manual_of_non_linear_dynamics.pdf. 
Be honest with yourself. Solve things you might have problems with. You don't need perfection. Even spending a year, you won't find it. 
Just do some tasks, and watch two lectures per week. If you find that you don't understanding anything anymore, slow down. Go back. etc. 


# Analysis

On Sundays, try to write a little summary of what you've learned, and how it has been. I guess do that early in the morning, after meditation/writing.
Then continue wherever you are. With coding tasks. Coding is essential, because that's where you actually build a portfolio through GitHub. 



# Structure

There will be three folders: "neuroscience", "dynamics" and "personal".
In the folders there will be subfolders for python tasks called "Coding tasks", and another called "misc" for various other things.
I will mainly use python, but might also use other languages as I find suitable or which I'd like to invest more time into learning. MATLAB, LUA and perhaps C/C++ are likely contenders. 
In each main folder I will have a document which updates weekly together with the analysis. This will probably be written in latex.
